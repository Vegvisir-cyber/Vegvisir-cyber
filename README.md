# Vegvísir

> *"If this sign is carried, one will never lose their way in storms or bad weather, even when the way is unknown."*

I walk quietly.

A background in frontline tech support. A taste for chaos contained.  
Now stepping into cyber as **Vegvísir** — the compass, the storm guide, the shadow.

My path is not to be loud.  
My path is to be *precise.*
